# About the data

The data is pulled from the FBI UCR API using a modified version of the FBI R package. Agencies are identified from the crosswalk data. 287(g) counties are flagged by the Post.

Special thanks to Jacob Kaplan, for creating the [fbi package](https://github.com/jacobkap/fbi) to help explore the FBI's [Crime Data Explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/) api and advice on working with UCR data. Also thanks to the [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/index.html) for their [Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/35158/summary).
